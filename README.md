# 🐱 Purr - The Ultimate Fuzzing Helper 🐾
# Development stopped someone pointed out i can just do this in bash so revamp here i come 


## STILL IN PROGRESS - EMOJI OVERLOAD INCOMING 


Have you ever **forgotten** the command to fuzz a directory? 😵‍💫  
And then you go, *"Hmmmmmmm, did I do this right?"* 🧐  
Or even worse... *"Hmmmmmmmmmm, can I just do ALL types of fuzzing at once?"* 😡  
...and have my results properly and nicely formatted? 👻  

Yeah, same. **I always have this issue, and I hate it.**  
So, I decided to **screw remembering the command** and just have a Python script do it all for me.  

## 🎤 Introducing... **Purr!** 🐱  
*(No, not Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, just Purr.)*
